…a simple static blog template for [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/).

Since I will start using this right now despite the somewhat cluttered file and folder structure and lots of not-finished or have-to-be-redone details, I hereby declare this the 0.1.0. \*Fanfare!\*

- produces static blog with the [Middleman blog addon](http://middlemanapp.com/blogging/) which can be published via [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
- Tumblr-like post types (so far articles, link-posts, image-posts and linked image-posts are available – quotes, video and audio might follow maybe)
- runs on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Haml](http://haml.info/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- consistent separation of content and structure
- Rails-like asset path

Pro tip:
     ln -s ~/Dropbox/path/to/your/posts/ source/content/posts/

## How to use

Coming soon… 
- edit config
- edit feed
- edit CNAME

## Todos
- Something is still wrong with the feed
- reduce font-face rules to what is actually used
